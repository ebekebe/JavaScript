A simple yokai search form, making this just to practice using a JSON file I wrote earlier.

#Edit: Once I have this functionally doing what I wanted it to do, which is just filter based on what elements have been clicked, and what text was entered. I am going to abandon it becaise it is ugly as sin and I can live with that.
